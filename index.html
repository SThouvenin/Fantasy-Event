                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Stacy McQuerrey is a photographer from Galion, Ohio. She has the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met. This shoot is being put together as a benefit to help her and her family, and every penny will go to help her and her family. Stacy is an amazing photographer, and friend to many. <br><br>

                        For those of you that don't know Stacy well, but have seen her work - She is planning to sell her photography equipment to try to keep a roof over her family's head. She and her husband both work full-time and parent 3 kids. She fell sick at the end of last year with a blood clot in her leg and pneumonia, that's when the medical bills started to catch up with them. PLEASE help them keep a roof over their heads. She has had many people rallying around her, so please spread the word so we help her in anyway we can. She was just given the total that needs paid and it is a large sum, She needs $4,000 by June 23rd in order to keep her home.<br><br>

                        **MEETING PLACE** - Stacy's Brother's at 29771 Rabbit Ridge Rd Howard, Ohio 43028! JUNE 17th 7am-8pm<br><br>

                        The theme of the shoot is Fantasy- but photographers and models are free to create their own ideas and styles. It has been amazing to see everyone rallying together to support one of their own in the photography community. <br> <br>

                        The cost of attending is a minimum $25 donation! (Hair and makeup get to come free!) I will be setting up PayPal for it in the next days and will be keeping track! Please do not schedule with photographers or models if you have not yet made a contribution! <br> <br>

                        MAKE-UP ARTISTS<br>

                        PHOTOGRAPHERS<br>
                        Please understand the name of the shoot is Fantasy- but you can go with your own style and visions. Being in a private location - Nudes and artistic nudes are permitted. This is a trade event so please communicate with the models what they can expect to receive in regards to photos. ie- 5 edited shots, watermark or no watermark, how many outfit changes there will be. If you have them, I recommend bringing a release. These negotiations will be between you and the model, and I will not set expectations and deadlines. PLEASE stay in communication with the models after the shoot. We also will love behind the scenes photos!<br><br>

                        MODELS<br>
                        After the event, models will receive the best edited images. The negotiations over picture will be between you and the photographer. Feel free to roam around and hang out, there will be food, friends and fun! Though the theme is Fantasy - Bring any style of clothing and go ham!<br><br>

                        WARDROBE<br>
                        Anyone attending as a wardrobe stylist and not a photographer or model, can attend at no charge. The wardrobist is welcome to sell their product at the event as well. A wardrobe person can also rent their wares.<br><br>

                        PETS<br>

                        INTERIOR SHOOTING<br>
                        The interior areas for shooting are the barn and the open building. The barn will be the only indoor spot with electricity. <br><br>

                        NUDE SHOOTING<br>
                        Keep in mind that minors are permitted at this event and if you are a photographer that will be shooting nude models, you must register with the staff at check in. Nude and implied shooting is ALLOWED, but we will be limiting the areas of shooting due to Minors being in attendance. LOCATIONS for nude shooting will be announced soon. If requesting to have a model shoot nude, always show respect. Please request it privately and ASK A MODEL ONLY ONCE, if the model says no, then NO MEANS NO. Any reported pressuring, persuasive overtly sexual language, or harassment of any kind will result in dismissal from the event.<br><br>

                        RAIN DATE<br>
                        We will set a rain date if this one does not work.<br><br>
